3D using bitblting in Windows.  

These files can kick-start someone new to 3D programming. Each folder contains only one source code file. There is a complete 3D game as well as a simple platformer demo making this a great teaching tool.

These files are free to use but if you wish to donate you can at [paypal.me/CMogged](https://www.paypal.me/CMogged).
